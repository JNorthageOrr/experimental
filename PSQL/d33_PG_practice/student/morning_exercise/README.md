# Ease back into JS
![JS](http://i.giphy.com/tz4WcYi0tJM5y.gif)

## Introduction
As a class we haven't touched JS since before break, so I thought it would be nice to exercise our JavaScripting powers and show ourselves that we still know what we're doing.

## Setup
Using the `mornex.js` file provided accomplish the following exercise.

## Assignment
The provided JavaScript file contains an array of objects containing studnet's names and github handles. Using this array do the following:
- Create a function that returns a string in the following form:
```
Name: Bobby King
Github: gittheking
```
- Create a function that returns the list of students that have numbers in their github handles
- Create a function that reverses the letters in everyone's github.
- Create a function to sort everyone by their last name
- Create a function to l337-speak everyone's names (replaces all the letters in everyone's name with numbers where applicable - look back to the ruby hw with the stringhelper module)
